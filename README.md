GeekTrust Finding Falcone coding challenge.

King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing,
Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor. However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these
planets.
This coding problem is to help King Shan find Al Falcone.

This UI will enable King Shan to -
• select 4 planets to search (out of the total 6)
• select which space vehicles to send to these planets
• see how much time it will take for the vehicles to reach their targets &
• show final result of success or failure
